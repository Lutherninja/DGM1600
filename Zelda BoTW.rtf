\f0\fs24 \cf0 I\'92m gonna tell you some things I like and don\'92t like about Zelda BoTW\
\
I really enjoyed the openness of the world, making exploring surprisingly rewarding with Koroks and shrines to distract you\
\
I wish there was a larger variety of enemies. I loved the big monsters such and Hinox, Talus, and Lynel, BUT they weren\'92t as common. I got a little sick of smacking Bokoblins, and Moblins and Lizalfos over and over and over again.\
\
The music was WONDERFUL!  Capturing the feel of the game. I loved the cameos and little tunes from previous games. BUT there was too little music in the game. I feel like I only got to enjoy the music every now and then, wishing to always have some music playing.}
