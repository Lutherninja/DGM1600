Shovel knight is by far one of the best games made ever.
The visuals are crisp and the gameplay is as solid as it gets.
The music is INCREDIBLE! Catchy tunes that utilize the style of the game perfectly. Fantastic soundtrack.
Character design is also super well done. All with different backgrounds and personalities making you wonder more about their true character and if you will ever get to learn more about them.
